Welcome to Food Fiesta, your go-to destination for exploring and ordering delicious dishes online! This project is a side venture by a passionate React developer (that's me!) with 6 months of experience. Food Fiesta is designed to provide a seamless and enjoyable food ordering experience, and it's built using React, Tailwind, Redux, and the Google Maps API.
